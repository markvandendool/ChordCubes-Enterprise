## 🎭 ISSUE 1: Performance Mode Lighting System
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED  
**Priority:** High  
**Component:** Visual/Lighting System  

### Problem Description
When users locked both bass and melody (entering performance mode), the shelf would correctly darken initially. However, during playback, the shelf would inappropriately brighten back up, making front row chords difficult to read and defeating the purpose of performance mode.

### Root Cause Analysis
The lighting reset functions were applying default brightness values without considering the performance mode state. The system lacked intelligence to maintain appropriate lighting based on user's locked voice configuration.

### Technical Solution Implemented
```javascript
// Added performance mode detection
function isPerformanceMode() {
    return lineup.length && lockedMelody && lockedBass && 
           lockedMelody.length === lineup.length && lockedBass.length === lineup.length;
}

// Smart lighting application
function applyPerformanceLighting() {
    if (isPerformanceMode()) {
        console.log('[PERFORMANCE LIGHTING] Maintaining performance mode lighting during playback');
        if (ambient) ambient.intensity = 0.15; // Keep shelf dark
        if (dir) dir.intensity = 0.25; // Keep shelf dark
    }
}
```

### Files Modified
- `main.js` (lines 543-558, 6812, 6863, 10565, 11506)

### Testing Results
✅ Performance mode maintains dark shelf throughout playback  
✅ Front row chords remain clearly visible  
✅ Normal lighting restored when exiting performance mode

## 🎼 ISSUE 2: 2D Musical Staves Disappearing
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED  
**Priority:** High  
**Component:** Musical Notation System  

### Problem Description
The 2D musical staves overlay would not appear during playback, even when the "Show Staves" button was clicked. The staves creation was triggered but nothing visible would render.

### Root Cause Analysis
The staves system required both `isUserEnabled` AND `isPlaybackActive` flags to be true for visibility. While the transport system properly set `setPlaybackActive(true)`, other playback paths (direct progression, solo modes) were missing this crucial notification.

### Technical Solution Implemented
Added staves notifications to all playback pathways:

```javascript
// Direct Progression Playback
if (window.musicalStaves3D) {
    window.musicalStaves3D.setPlaybackActive(true);
    window.musicalStaves3D.displayChordProgression(lineup.map(c => ({ roman: c.userData.roman })));
    console.log('[DIRECT PLAY] 🎼 Staves notified of playback start');
}
```

### VexFlow Integration Analysis
**Library:** VexFlow 4.2.2 (Open Source Music Notation)  
**Source:** https://unpkg.com/vexflow@4.2.2/build/cjs/vexflow.js  
**Rendering:** Canvas-based professional music notation  
**Implementation:** Simplified direct note drawing approach  

### Files Modified
- `main.js` (lines 6645-6650, 10516-10521, 10536-10541)
- `musical-staves-3d.js` (lines 259-305)

### Testing Results
✅ Staves appear immediately when playback starts  
✅ Beautiful treble and bass clef notation with actual notes  
✅ Roman numerals displayed above staves  
✅ Responsive design in top 1/4th of screen

## 🔇 ISSUE 3: Audio Chord Bleeding (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Component:** Audio Engine  

### Problem Description
During progression playback, especially with string instruments (cello, violin), new chords would play while previous chords were still sustaining, creating muddy, overlapping audio that was "miserably hard to listen to."

### Root Cause Analysis
The `cutoffCurrentChord()` function existed in the audio engine but was only being utilized in free-play mode. Progression playback systems were not calling this function before playing new chords, causing audio overlap.

### Technical Solution Implemented
Added cutoff calls before every audio playback throughout the system:

```javascript
// Main Progression Playback
if (window.audioEngine) {
    // 🔇 CRITICAL: Cut off previous chord before playing new one
    window.audioEngine.cutoffCurrentChord();
    console.log('[PROGRESSION] 🔇 Cut off previous chord before playing new chord');
    window.audioEngine.playChord(chordNotes, secondsPerMeasure * 0.95, 0.7);
}
```

### Areas Fixed
- Main progression playback (line 6744)
- Melody solo playback (lines 10652, 10682)
- Bass solo playback (lines 10715, 10748)
- Both locked and face-derived note systems

### Files Modified
- `main.js` (comprehensive audio cutoff implementation)

### Testing Results
✅ Crystal clear chord transitions  
✅ No audio overlap or bleeding  
✅ Perfect with all instruments including cello/violin  
✅ Maintains musical expression without muddiness

## 🔐 ISSUE 4: Reset Button Lock Clearing
**Status:** ✅ VERIFIED WORKING  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Component:** User Interface  

### Problem Description
User requested that the reset button should unlock melody and bass locks in addition to its existing functionality.

### Analysis Results
Investigation revealed the reset button already included comprehensive unlock functionality in PHASE 3 of the enhanced reset system:

```javascript
// PHASE 3: UNLOCK ALL VOICES (MELODY, BASS, CHORDS)
console.log('[ENHANCED RESET] 🔓 Unlocking all voices');
try {
    // Clear melody locks
    lockedMelody = null;
    renderMelodyLane();
    setMelodyLockVisual('open');

    // Clear bass locks
    lockedBass = null;
    renderBassLane();
    setBassLockVisual('open');

    // Clear locked lines
    clearLockedLines();
} catch (e) { console.log('[ENHANCED RESET] ⚠️ Lock clearing failed:', e); }
```

### Files Analyzed
- `main.js` (lines 8069-8087)

### Testing Results
✅ Reset button properly unlocks all melody locks  
✅ Reset button properly unlocks all bass locks  
✅ Visual indicators correctly updated to 'open' state  
✅ All locked lines cleared from display

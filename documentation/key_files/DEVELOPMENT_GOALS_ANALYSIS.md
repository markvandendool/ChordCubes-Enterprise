## Overall Development Progress Score: 48/100

While ChordCubes shows promise as a 3D chord visualization tool, significant work remains to address technical debt, implement missing features, and create a proper deployment pipeline. Today's work in documenting the current state and creating clear to-do lists represents an important step forward, but substantial effort is still required to make the application production-ready and maintainable.

## Key Achievements Today:

1. Created comprehensive documentation of current system state
2. Established clear to-do list with detailed requirements
3. Centralized key documentation in logical structure
4. Identified critical missing components and dependencies
5. Created verification steps for testing functionality
6. Established plan for addressing technical debt

## Critical Next Steps:

1. Fix missing dependencies (transport-bridge.js)
2. Standardize version information across all files
3. Implement highest priority items from Phoenix-Claude To-Do.txt
4. Create proper build and deployment pipeline
5. Develop automated testing framework
6. Address production URL issues
